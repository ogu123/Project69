        I had visted McDonalds on 19th of July 2022

        <p class="text-muted text-left">McDonalds was about 2 miles away from my house. I ate 20 McNuggets on my own and I went with my mum, dad and two brothers. I also tried an Oreo McFlurry for the first time and it tasted pretty good. The food was fantastic and I was served very well by the people who were serving there. The car ride to and from the restaurant was also very fun as we played music and sung along with it.</p>

            <p>I saw the movie on 24th of August 2020 with 3 of my friends. We went to the cinema at around  2 in the afternoon and we all came out really enjoying the whole experience. We loved all the action that the movie contained, but we were also sad that Iron Man died at the end.</p>

        <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">Established carmakers around the world are ripping up their business models in the hope of adapting to a new world in which electricity replaces gasoline and diesel. Factories are being overhauled to produce electric cars, and automakers are snapping up every battery they can find. The high cost of developing electric cars is forcing some companies to find partners and turning others into acquisition targets. The need to meet strict emissions standards in China and Europe means that executives are paying far more attention to the policies being put in place in Beijing or Brussels, than what rivals are building in Detroit or Wolfsburg</p>
